I copied all these simulations from Cesare's directory:

/mnt/sequencedb/PopGen/cesare/bs_genomescan/simulations/msms/


so that I can work on them without having the risk of loosing them.


The names are almost self-explanatory:

n20, n60, n100: number of sampled individuals


neutral simulations

The other ones have selection...

Tbs1,3,5: time since appearance of the balanced polymorphism.

f0.1...0.5: frequency equilibrium for the simulations with balancing selection.
