### in the directory 'scan_may_2014' I analyse scan results for all  populations from NCV-with-FD
### In the directory 'scan+sept_2014_no_FD' I analyse scab results for all populations from NCV-no-FD
### scratch is a copy of what used to be in my /mnt/scratch/barbara folder, but I had to empty the space ans I moed it here. It basically contains all the scan results.
##BALLET: directory with BALLET program from Deiorgio et al. 2014. It is also where I have the results from T1 and T2 tests (tmp) and the pertinent scripts.
