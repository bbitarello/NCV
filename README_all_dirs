### In the directory 'simulations/msms_sims/' we have all NCV simulations and their analyses.##
### In the directory 'vcf_practice' we have all data and analyses for 1000g data.##
### in the directory 'scan_may_2014' I analyse scan results for all  populations from NCV-with-FD
### In the directory 'scan+sept_2014_no_FD' I analyse scab results for all populations from NCV-no-FD
### scratch is a copy of what used to be in my /mnt/scratch/barbara folder, but I had to empty the space ans I moed it here. It basically contains all the scan results.
##  BALLET: directory with BALLET program from Deiorgio et al. 2014. It is also where I have the results from T1 and T2 tests (tmp) and the pertinent scripts.
### NCV_intial_testing #some preliminary exploration of NCV, in its early stages. This dir used to be in barbara/msms_sims/ but Imoved it here on 27/11/2014//
### ncv/logs/  #logs from qsub from when I ran the scan.
### SCRIPTS used to be in simulations/, which made no sense, so I moved it here. It contains many of the scripts I used for several steps of the project.
